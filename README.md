# Blue Card
This is a web-application using Flask that will allow firefighters to practice their size ups on different types of structures and get feedback based on how they did. Size ups are done using Blue Card which is a type of Incident Command System. It is used at every call that involves a building that is potentially on fire. From my experience in the fire department, Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people struggle to do their size ups correctly over the radio. I feel that this Flask would be able to improve firefighters experience with Blue Card and become more comfortable and familiar with it. The user would go to the application, a picture is randomly chosen for the user, the firefighter inputs their size up of the structure and is finally given feedback on their size up.
